## PennHacks Fall 2021
See https://devpost.com/software/nuresearch
## Inspiration
Our inspiration is based on hearing from industry colleagues that they often need to do research to keep up with the new research occurring in their domain. Research materials are often spread across multiple different sites and require users to actively search through information. 

## What it does
We have created a web application that scrapes RSS feeds from the web and consolidates the information. 

## How we built it
For our backend we are using google cloud Postgres storage, as well as pythonFastApi; and our front end uses react and a CSS framework called bulma. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some challenges with integrating with the database 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the various moving pieces coming together from the backend to the front end. 

## What we learned
We learned about various different tools to help with development as well as the value of working in a team to debug/ troubleshoot issues. 

## What's next for nuResearch
For the future, we also plan to use Twillio Sendgrid to send out email notifications to subscribers.
